This project aims to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer in the study. Using the dropdown menu, you may choose each volunteer to display. Of course, all data has been deidentified for confidentiality purposes. In the charts showm, you see that volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
